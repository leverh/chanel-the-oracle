## 🐱 About Chanel

Chanel is a loving rescue cat who found her way to her forever home from a shelter over 8 years ago. Now 15 years young, she takes her oracle duties very seriously while enjoying adventures in her cat stroller to explore the world. She believes all of life's answers can be found through the wisdom of treat jars, sunny windowsills, and the ancient art of 3am zoomies.

While Chanel happens to be a Scottish Fold, it's important to know that this breed often faces significant health challenges due to genetic mutations affecting bones, cartilage, airways, and tear ducts. I encourage everyone to choose adoption over purchasing from breeders - there are countless amazing cats of all types waiting in shelters for their perfect match!

## 🐾 REMEMBER! 🐾

### 🏠 Adopt Don't Shop 🛍️

Every year, millions of wonderful animals wait in shelters for loving homes, while many others never get that chance. When you adopt, you're not just bringing home a pet – you're saving a life, creating space for another animal in need, and taking a stand against harmful breeding practices.

Shelter pets bring just as much love, loyalty, and companionship as any pet from a breeder or store. Each has their own unique personality and backstory, waiting for someone to give them a second chance. Many are already trained, vaccinated, and ready to become your perfect companion.

By choosing adoption, you'll experience the incomparable joy of watching a formerly homeless animal blossom in a loving environment – there's simply no feeling like the gratitude of a rescued pet. 🐱 🐶 🐰 💕

*Remember: When you adopt, you're not just changing an animal's life – they're changing yours too.*
